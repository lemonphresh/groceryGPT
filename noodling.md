### to do for v2:

- need to refine prompt again

### code ideas:

- make the schema files on gql project less sad looking
- might want to add storybook because testing components sucks rn
- set up CI :(

### product ideas:

- a form that accepts names of meals you want and ingredients you already have and then it outputs a grocery list
- a form that accepts ingredients you already have, dietary restrictions, etc and maybe a checkbox that determines whether or not you want to try to find a recipe that uses most of the existing ingredients or if it does not matter
- seasonal ingredients?

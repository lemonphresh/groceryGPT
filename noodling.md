### to do for v2:

x set up a new repo for database shit (grocery-graphql)
x add react router to this project :(
x probably get auth going

- add keyboard interactions to register and login forms
- add user pantry
- add saving/deleting ingredients support
- make the schema files on gql project less sad looking

### code ideas:

- might want to add storybook because testing components sucks rn
- set up CI :(

### product ideas:

- a form that accepts names of meals you want and ingredients you already have and then it outputs a grocery list
- a form that accepts ingredients you already have, dietary restrictions, etc and maybe a checkbox that determines whether or not you want to try to find a recipe that uses most of the existing ingredients or if it does not matter
- seasonal ingredients?

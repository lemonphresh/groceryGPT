### to do for v2:

- set up a new repo for database shit
- add react router to this project :(
- probably get oauth going

### code ideas:

- might want to add storybook because testing components sucks rn
- set up CI :(
- xander-proof the ai
- change my email to another one so i dont get spammed probably

### product ideas:

- a form that accepts names of meals you want and ingredients you already have and then it outputs a grocery list
- a form that accepts ingredients you already have, dietary restrictions, etc and maybe a checkbox that determines whether or not you want to try to find a recipe that uses most of the existing ingredients or if it does not matter
- seasonal ingredients?
